<div class="intro"><p>We would like you to join us at the Financial Times to brainstorm meaningful solutions for the future of Britain. Our 2m-plus readership includes people making the important decisions in business and politics every day. Join them and us in a conversation about the future. Share your ideas below. We are publishing excerpts from the best of them <a href="https://ig.ft.com/future-of-britain/">here</a>, outside of our paywall. You have at most 600 words, just enough to make a persuasive case for what you think is the right way forward.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how it works: in the form below, help us answer one of four big questions. Throughout November, we will continue to update <a href="https://ig.ft.com/future-of-britain/">this app</a> with compelling ideas. Your submissions will be judged separately by a panel, and the best few will be published as full op-eds. Those authors will be invited to discuss their thoughts alongside FT commentators at a live event in London in January.</p></div>

<p><b>This form will close on Thursday, November 10 at 4PM GMT. Explore the <a href="https://www.ft.com/the-future-of-britain-project">entire project here</a>. </b></p>
